<b><u>Start</u></b><br><br>

Before the first round the characters of all factions are randomly placed on a habitable field (Free or Barseat).<br>
<br>

<b><u>Main Loop</u></b><br><br>

No Time to Spy is a round based strategy game. Each round the characters take turns in completing their movements and
actions. At the beginning of each round the server handles tasks like refilling empty bar tables with cocktails and
checking failure rates of gadgets.<br>
Then the characters of all factions are queued up in random order. The turn of a character consists of multiple
actions. In his turn the character can spend his previously assigned number of action and movement points.<br>
A characters turn ends if either his action and movement points drop to zero or he retires thus wasting his remaining
action and movement points. <br><br>

<b><u>End of game</u></b><br><br>

The game ends once the white cat has her diamond collar back.<br>
This either happens when a character moves on the cats field while having the diamond collar in his inventory or by
handing it to the cat with a gadget action while standing on a neighboring field. The cat awards the faction a number of
intelligence points specified in the match configuration.<br>
The cat can pick up the diamond collar from a field if a character drops it.<br><br>
